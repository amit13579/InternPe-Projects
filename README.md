# InternPe-Projects
“This repository showcases my work during a one-month internship with InternPe. It contains four engaging projects developed using C++. The projects include a ‘Guess a Number’ game, a ‘Rock Paper Scissors’ game, a ‘Connect Four’ game, and a ‘Tic Tac Toe’ game. Each project demonstrates my problem-solving skills and proficiency in C++.”
