I've developed a fun and engaging "Guess the Number" game using C++. 🎮 This game challenges users to match a number randomly generated by the computer, within a range of 1 to 100. 🎲

Here's how it works:
1️⃣ The system generates a random number.
2️⃣ The user is prompted to enter their guess.
3️⃣ The computer provides feedback if the guess matches, or if it's higher or lower than the generated number.
4️⃣ The game continues until the user guesses the number correctly.

But that's not all! I've also incorporated some additional features to make the game even more interesting:
- Limiting the number of attempts 🔄
- Adding more rounds for extended play 🔄
- Displaying scores to track progress 📊
- Awarding points based on the number of attempts 🏆

This project was a fantastic opportunity to sharpen my C++ skills and I'm looking forward to tackling more challenging tasks in the future! 💪
